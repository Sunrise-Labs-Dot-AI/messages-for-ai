==================================================================
✓ Install complete. Bundle signed by Team $EXPECTED_TEAM_ID, seal verified.

Three things you need to do manually:

1. GRANT FULL DISK ACCESS to **Messages for AI.app** so the inner MCP
   binary can read chat.db (your iMessage history):

     System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access
     Click "+" → navigate to /Applications → select "Messages for AI"
     (the .app, NOT the inner binary) → Open → confirm toggle is ON

   IMPORTANT: drag the .app itself, not the inner Mach-O. macOS keys
   FDA grants by the bundle's CFBundleIdentifier
   (com.sunriselabs.messages-for-ai); the inner MCP binary shares that
   identifier so one .app-level grant covers both binaries inside.

2. CONFIGURE CLAUDE DESKTOP to use the MCP. Edit:

     ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

   Add (or merge into existing mcpServers):

     {
       "mcpServers": {
         "imessage-drafts": {
           "command": "$BIN_SYMLINK"
         }
       }
     }

   The path can be either the symlink ($BIN_SYMLINK) or the direct
   .app-internal binary ($APP_MCP_BIN) — they resolve to the same
   Mach-O.

   Then quit Claude Desktop entirely (Cmd+Q on the Claude menu, NOT
   just closing the window) and reopen it.

3. LAUNCH THE MENU BAR APP:

     open "$APP_DEST"

   On first popover open, macOS will ask:
     "Messages for AI Would Like to Access Your Contacts"
   Click OK. The app populates a sidecar (~/.messages-mcp/contacts-cache.json)
   that the MCP reads to resolve recipient names.

After these three steps, in a Claude Desktop chat ask:
   "Call the health_check tool from the imessage-drafts MCP."
You should see chatdb.open_status: ok and fda_likely_missing: false.
If you see permission_denied, double-check that **Messages for AI.app**
(not the inner binary) is in the FDA list and toggled ON.
