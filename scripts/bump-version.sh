# bump-version.sh <version> — set every "soft" version string to <version>.
#
# The .app's own version is NOT here: build-release.sh stamps
# CFBundleShortVersionString straight from its <version> argument. This
# script handles the three files that DON'T follow that arg automatically —
# the Claude Code plugin manifest and the two MCP package manifests — so a
# single release version propagates everywhere (lockstep release, option A).
#
# Files patched (top-level "version" field only):
#   - .claude-plugin/plugin.json
#   - mcps/imessage-drafts/package.json
#   - mcps/whatsapp-drafts/package.json
#
# Accepts the version with or without a leading "v" (v0.3.4 or 0.3.4); the
# files always get the bare number (0.3.4). Idempotent — safe to re-run.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/bump-version.sh v0.3.4
#   bash scripts/bump-version.sh 0.3.4
#
# Normally you don't call this directly — scripts/release.sh runs it for you.
