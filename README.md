# whatsapp-mcp

> **Status:** pre-v0.1.0 — scaffolding stage. Not ready for use.

Local MCP server for **WhatsApp on macOS**. Sibling to
[`imessage-mcp`](https://github.com/Sunrise-Labs-Dot-AI/imessage-mcp); shares
the same draft-first / hold-to-fire safety model.

Built on:

- **[Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys)** for the WhatsApp
  Multi-Device protocol (you pair this Mac as a linked device, same as
  WhatsApp Desktop)
- **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** runtime + `bun:sqlite` for storage
- **[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)** stdio
  transport for Claude integration

## How it differs from imessage-mcp

| | imessage-mcp | whatsapp-mcp |
|---|---|---|
| Source of truth | macOS `chat.db` (local SQLite) | Baileys WebSocket to Meta servers |
| Process model | stdio fork on demand | Persistent daemon + thin stdio MCP |
| Credentials | Apple's (OS-managed) | Ours (Keychain-wrapped session.db) |
| Account ban risk | None | Real — Meta polices automated clients |
| Setup | Grant Full Disk Access | Scan a QR code (once) |

## Status by phase

- [ ] **Phase 1** — daemon + read-only MCP tools
- [ ] **Phase 2** — draft staging + send with full rate-limit/audit stack
- [ ] **Phase 3** — menu bar app integration (in `imessage-mcp` repo)
- [ ] **Phase 4** — docs + SECURITY.md + first release

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and the planning doc
(internal) for the full design.

## ⚠️ WhatsApp Terms of Service

This project uses **Baileys**, a reverse-engineered implementation of
WhatsApp's Multi-Device protocol. Using third-party WhatsApp clients
**may violate WhatsApp's Terms of Service**. Bans target the **phone
number itself** — a banned number cannot be recovered on any device.

The defaults in this project are conservative for single-user personal-
reply use. **Use at your own risk.** See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for
the full threat model and risk disclosure once it's written.

## Architecture (TL;DR)

```
launchd
  └── whatsapp-daemon (persistent, code-signed)
        ├── Baileys WebSocket ←→ Meta servers
        ├── Unix socket: ~/.whatsapp-mcp/daemon.sock (peer-authed)
        ├── session.db    (AES-GCM wrapped via Keychain)
        ├── messages.db   (live message cache)
        ├── audit.db      (atomic cap + send log)
        └── drafts/       (staged but not yet sent)

Claude forks: whatsapp-mcp (stdio MCP) → talks to daemon.sock

iMessage Drafts.app (in imessage-mcp repo, extended) watches both
~/.imessage-mcp/drafts/ and ~/.whatsapp-mcp/drafts/
```
