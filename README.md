# Messages for AI

**AI proposes, you approve.** A safer messaging MCP for users who don't
want Claude sending messages on their behalf without a human in the loop.

`Messages for AI.app` is a single drag-to-/Applications install. The
.app bundles the menu bar UI plus every supported MCP transport — the
iMessage stdio MCP, the WhatsApp stdio MCP, and the WhatsApp background
daemon — all signed under one bundle identity so a single Full Disk
Access grant covers everything. On first launch, an onboarding wizard
asks which transports you want enabled.

**v0.3.0 ships two transports: iMessage and WhatsApp.** Signal and
Slack remain on the roadmap.

## How this differs from the official Anthropic iMessage plugin

[Anthropic ships an official iMessage plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/external_plugins/imessage)
that lets Claude send iMessages directly. It's great if you want
frictionless automation. This project exists for the *other* lane — users
who want AI assistance with a safety gate. Pick the one that matches your
risk tolerance:

Claims below describe Anthropic's plugin as published at the linked commit on 2026-05-18; verify against [their repo](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/external_plugins/imessage) if checking later.

| | Anthropic `imessage` plugin | Messages for AI (this project) |
|---|---|---|
| **Send model** | Direct — Claude sends immediately on tool call | Staged (default) — `send_draft` is gated by a `require_approval` toggle that ships ON; sends route through the menu bar's hold-to-fire Send button. Users can disable the toggle in the menu bar footer to allow direct MCP sends. |
| **Approval surface** | macOS Automation TCC prompt on first send only | Menu bar review: hold-to-fire Send / Discard per draft (no in-place edit yet — discard and re-stage instead) |
| **Audit log** | Not present at the linked revision | Every **successful** MCP send appended to `~/.messages-mcp/send-audit.log` with timestamp, recipient handle, and SHA-256 of body. Discards and blocked sends are not currently logged. |
| **UI** | CLI-only | Menu bar surface with thread-context bubbles |
| **Contact resolution** | Raw handles only | Resolves to Contacts names via local sidecar |
| **Transports** | iMessage only | iMessage + WhatsApp (v0.3.0); Signal / Slack on the roadmap (per-transport MCPs sharing one menu bar) |
| **Daily send cap** | Not present at the linked revision | Circuit-breaker default 50/UTC-day, env-configurable via `IMESSAGE_DAILY_SEND_CAP` |
| **Best for** | "Just send the message" automation | "Let me see what Claude wants to say before it goes out" — when the default approval gate is on |

If you want fire-and-forget, use Anthropic's plugin. If you want every
outgoing message to pass through your eye first, use this one.

## What this gives you

- **iMessage transport**: read threads, messages, search; stage drafts
  under `~/.messages-mcp/drafts/`; approval-gated send via AppleScript
  automation of Messages.app.
- **WhatsApp transport** (opt-in): read recent threads from a local
  cache; stage drafts under `~/.whatsapp-mcp/drafts/`; approval-gated
  send via a background Baileys daemon paired to your phone over QR
  scan. The daemon is bundled inside the .app — there's no separate
  install. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the WhatsApp ToS caveat
  and per-transport threat model before enabling.
- **Menu bar surface** that shows pending drafts from every enabled
  transport in one popover, with hold-to-fire Send / Discard buttons
  and per-transport platform badges (green for WhatsApp, system accent
  for iMessage). Turns "draft" into a real human-review surface rather
  than a JSON file on disk.
- **First-run onboarding wizard** that asks which transports you want
  enabled and chains directly into WhatsApp QR pairing when you opt in.
- **Settings sheet** for per-transport configuration and pair/unpair.
- Contact-name resolution via the menu bar app's Contacts permission —
  agents see and surface real names ("Allegra Heath"), not raw phone
  numbers.
- Designed for **local MCP clients** (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex
  CLI). The WhatsApp daemon opens a WebSocket to WhatsApp Web; no other
  network surfaces.

## Security

This server gives a local binary three macOS-level privileges (Full Disk
Access, Automation control of Messages.app, optional Open-at-Login). The
trust profile is non-trivial. Read **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** before
installing — it covers the full threat model, the mitigations in place
(prompt-injection wrapping, minimum staged-age, daily send cap, audit
log, SQL parameterization, etc.), the configuration knobs, and the
recommended user-side practices.

For vulnerability reports: open a GitHub Security Advisory on the repo.

## Why this exists

The agents calling this server run on the same Mac as the Messages data.
A local stdio MCP server is the right shape — no tunnel, no cloud, no
shared secret. The blast radius is "what a process running as you can
already do."

## Tools

The iMessage MCP server (`imessage-drafts-mcp`) exposes:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `list_threads` | Recent threads (newest first). Requires `since` or `contact_filter`. |
| `get_thread` | Messages in a thread, paginated via `before`. |
| `search_messages` | LIKE-search across `text`. Requires `query` plus `since` or `contact_filter`. |
| `stage_draft` | Write a draft to `~/.messages-mcp/drafts/{uuid}.json`. Resolves recipient name. Does NOT send. |
| `list_drafts` | List staged drafts, newest first. |
| `get_draft` | Read one staged draft. |
| `discard_draft` | Delete a staged draft. |
| `send_draft` | **Destructive.** Send a staged draft via Messages.app. Refuses duplicate sends. (Or send via the menu bar app — see below.) |
| `get_current_time` | UTC + system-local timestamps, for building `since` filters. |
| `health_check` | Diagnose permissions / contact lookup / chat.db access. Run when something silently isn't working. |

The WhatsApp MCP server (`whatsapp-drafts-mcp`) exposes a parallel set
of tools — see [mcps/whatsapp-drafts/README.md](mcps/whatsapp-drafts/README.md)
for the full surface and its differences from iMessage (rate limits,
session-pairing flow, daemon model).

Hard guardrails:

- `since` older than 2 years → rejected (no deep-history dumps).
- `query` shorter than 2 chars → rejected.
- All message bodies truncated at ~8 KB with a marker.

# Skills

Optional Claude skills that build on the MCP, bundled in this repo under [`skills/`](skills/):

- [`texting-analytics`](skills/texting-analytics/) — a personal "Texting Wrapped" report (reply latency, ball-in-court rate, group contribution) rendered as four charts. Read-only; runs against your iMessage history via the MCP. Needs Python with `matplotlib`.

More skills (voice-cloned drafting, birthday texts) are in progress.

# Install

Two paths. Pick A unless you're contributing code.

## Option A — Pre-built release (recommended)

The release zip contains a signed, Apple-notarized .app. No Xcode, no
Apple Developer account, no rebuild required, and no separate WhatsApp
install. Drag and drop, then three manual permission steps.

```sh
# 1. Download the latest release zip.
curl -L \
  https://github.com/Sunrise-Labs-Dot-AI/messages-for-ai/releases/latest/download/messages-for-ai.zip \
  -o /tmp/messages-for-ai.zip

# 2. Unzip and run the installer.
cd /tmp && unzip -q messages-for-ai.zip
cd messages-for-ai-v* && bash install.sh
```

The installer copies `Messages for AI.app` to `/Applications/`,
refreshes LaunchServices, smoke-tests the bundled MCP binaries via
`initialize` round-trips, creates a backward-compat symlink at
`~/bin/imessage-drafts-mcp` (legacy v0.1.x path), and prints the manual
next steps.

After running it, you need to:

1. **Grant Full Disk Access** to `Messages for AI.app` — see
   [Permissions](#permissions) below. One grant covers every binary
   inside the .app (iMessage MCP, WhatsApp MCP, WhatsApp daemon, the
   menubar UI).
2. **Wire up the MCP client** — see [MCP client config](#mcp-client-config) below.
3. **Launch the menu bar app**:
   ```sh
   open "/Applications/Messages for AI.app"
   ```
   First popover open will trigger the onboarding wizard. Pick which
   transports you want enabled (iMessage on by default; WhatsApp opt-
   in). If you check WhatsApp, the menubar spawns the daemon and
   chains directly into the QR pairing sheet — scan with WhatsApp on
   your phone via Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device. First
   popover open will also trigger the macOS Contacts consent dialog.

## Option B — Build from source

For contributors. Requires Bun, Xcode 15+, and an **Apple Developer ID
Application certificate** for full contact-name resolution. Without the
cert, contact lookup gracefully falls back to "raw phone numbers" mode
— the rest of the server works fine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sunrise-Labs-Dot-AI/messages-for-ai.git
cd messages-for-ai

# Step 1: Build and install the menu bar app to /Applications/.
# This MUST run first — it creates the Messages for AI.app bundle
# that the MCP binaries install INTO.
cd menubar && bash scripts/dev-install.sh && cd ..

# Step 2: Build and install ALL MCP binaries (iMessage MCP, WhatsApp
# MCP, WhatsApp daemon) into the .app's Contents/MacOS/, signed with
# the bundle identifier. Creates a backward-compat symlink at
# ~/bin/imessage-drafts-mcp for legacy MCP client configs.
bash scripts/dev-install.sh
```

Both install scripts auto-detect a Developer ID Application certificate
in your Keychain and use it for signing. If none is found, they fall
back to adhoc signing with a clear warning. To force a hard fail on
missing cert (for CI / release builds), set `CONTACTS_REQUIRE_DEVID=1`.

After rebuilding the MCP binary, **restart any MCP client that has
already spawned the old one** (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex CLI) —
they hold a long-lived stdio subprocess and won't pick up the new binary
until they re-spawn.

### Why Developer ID matters

Modern macOS (Sequoia+) silently blocks `CNContactStore.requestAccess`
for adhoc-signed apps. Without a Developer ID cert, the menu bar app
can't read your Contacts via the framework path. (FDA grants for adhoc
binaries also get invalidated on every rebuild, since TCC keys off the
binary hash.) See `menubar/scripts/messages-for-ai.entitlements` for
the Hardened Runtime entitlements required (`personal-information.
addressbook` + `automation.apple-events`).

---

# Permissions

Three TCC grants involved, each gated differently:

## 1. Full Disk Access (on `Messages for AI.app`)

Required to read `~/Library/Messages/chat.db`. There's no programmatic
prompt for FDA — you have to do it manually:

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access**.
2. Click **+**.
3. Press **⌘⇧G**, paste `/Applications`, press Enter.
4. Select **`Messages for AI`** (the .app bundle, NOT the inner binary
   and NOT the `~/bin/imessage-drafts-mcp` symlink) and click Open.
5. Confirm the toggle is **on**.

⚠️ **Drag the .app bundle, not the inner Mach-O or the symlink.** macOS
keys FDA grants by the bundle's `CFBundleIdentifier`
(`com.sunriselabs.messages-for-ai`). The inner MCP binary shares that
identifier so one .app-level grant covers it. Dragging the inner
binary (or its symlink at `~/bin/imessage-drafts-mcp`) resolves up to
the bundle either way — but explicitly targeting the .app is the
unambiguous Apple convention and what the installer printout instructs.

**Troubleshooting: tools return `authorization denied` / `permission_denied`.**
Run `health_check` from a Claude Desktop chat — it'll report which
subsystem is failing and the remediation. Common causes:

- **Forgot to restart Claude Desktop after granting FDA** — the MCP
  child is a long-lived subprocess that re-checks its TCC identity at
  spawn time. `Cmd+Q` Claude Desktop (NOT just close the window) and
  reopen so it forks a fresh child.
- **You dragged the inner binary into FDA in a previous attempt** —
  the resulting row in the FDA list may be stale. Remove it (`–`
  button) and re-add by dragging the `.app` from `/Applications`.
- **You upgraded from v0.1.x** — your old grant against
  `~/bin/imessage-mcp` (identifier `com.sunriselabs.imessage-mcp`)
  is no longer valid. v0.2.0 uses a different identifier
  (`com.sunriselabs.messages-for-ai`). You must grant FDA fresh to
  the new `.app` bundle.

With Developer ID signing in place (default for both the pre-built
release and source builds with a cert), the grant survives rebuilds —
TCC keys off the `(identifier, team-id)` tuple, which is stable.

## 2. Contacts (on the menu bar app)

Required to resolve recipient handles to names. Prompted natively on
first popover open: *"Messages for AI Would Like to Access Your Contacts."*
Click OK. The app then exports a `~/.messages-mcp/contacts-cache.json`
sidecar that the MCP reads on each `stage_draft` call.

The sidecar uses the same data source Messages.app uses, including
iCloud-synced contacts that may be CloudKit-only and absent from the
on-disk AddressBook SQLite. The sidecar refreshes automatically via
`CNContactStoreDidChangeNotification` whenever you edit a contact.

## 3. Automation (on the MCP client / menu bar app, targeting Messages.app)

Required to actually send a staged draft. Prompted on the first call to
`send_draft`: *"<parent app> wants to control Messages.app."*
Click **OK**; the grant persists.

To revoke later: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation →
your parent app → Messages → toggle off.

---

# MCP client config

> ⚠️ MCP client `command` fields vary in whether they expand `~`. Claude
> Desktop and Codex CLI do; some terminals' MCP plugins don't. If a
> client fails to launch the server, replace `~/bin/imessage-drafts-mcp` with
> the absolute path (`echo $HOME/bin/imessage-drafts-mcp`).

**Claude Desktop** — `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imessage-drafts": {
      "command": "~/bin/imessage-drafts-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop (Cmd+Q on the Claude menu, then reopen — the MCP
child only spawns on app launch).

**Claude Code** — add to `.mcp.json` in your project, or
`~/.claude/mcp.json` for global:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "imessage-drafts": { "command": "~/bin/imessage-drafts-mcp" }
  }
}
```

**Codex CLI** — `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.imessage-drafts]
command = "~/bin/imessage-drafts-mcp"
```

(Verify against current Codex docs — config shape may have shifted.)

# Quick smoke test (no client needed)

```sh
cat <<'EOF' | ~/bin/imessage-drafts-mcp 2>/tmp/imessage-drafts-mcp.stderr | tail -1
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"smoke","version":"0"}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_threads","arguments":{"limit":3,"since":"2026-05-06T00:00:00Z"}}}
EOF
```

If FDA is granted you'll see your three most-recent threads. Without
FDA the call returns `{"ok":false,"error":"list_threads failed: authorization denied"}`.

Also useful: `health_check` (via a Claude Desktop chat or
the smoke-test pattern above) reports the full live state of permissions
and contact lookup in one call.

---

# Sending drafts — the trust model

`send_draft({ draft_id })` consumes a draft staged via
`stage_draft` and sends it through Messages.app via AppleScript
automation. The design has four trust layers:

1. **MCP destructive annotation.** The tool advertises `destructiveHint: true`
   and `idempotentHint: false`, so MCP clients should surface a confirmation
   prompt before each call.
2. **Send-only-from-draft.** There's no ad-hoc send. Every send requires a
   `draft_id`, so the draft text is observable in the conversation transcript
   before the destructive tool fires — even if the agent calls
   `stage_draft` and `send_draft` in the same turn.
3. **Sent-state lock.** Once a draft has `sent_at` set, re-calling
   `send_draft` returns an explicit "refusing duplicate send"
   error. An agent looping on retry cannot double-send.
4. **macOS TCC Automation.** AppleScript control of Messages.app is gated
   by a separate TCC service from FDA: "Automation". See
   [Permissions](#permissions) above.

If you ever expose this server over a network transport (HTTP / WebSocket /
tunnel), **remove the send tool from the public surface**. The trust
boundary collapses the moment a non-local caller can invoke it — and the
read tools are useful on their own.

---

# Menu bar app

The MCP server stages drafts as JSON files. The companion app at
`/Applications/Messages for AI.app` is a SwiftUI `MenuBarExtra` that
surfaces pending drafts with hold-to-fire Send / Discard buttons — so
you actually review what an agent wants to send before it goes out,
rather than rubber-stamping a tool call that shows only a draft UUID.

### How it works

- Watches `~/.messages-mcp/drafts` via `DispatchSourceFileSystemObject`,
  so drafts staged by the MCP server appear in the popover within ~100ms.
- Sends through the same AppleScript path the MCP server uses
  (`osascript` + `tell application "Messages"`). The duplication is
  intentional — it avoids inventing IPC to the stdio MCP server.
- On send, atomically updates the same draft JSON with `sent_at` +
  `send_service`. Recently-sent drafts (within the last 24 hours) appear
  in a faded "Recently sent" section as a confirmation breadcrumb.
- **Contacts export**: on launch, the app calls `CNContactStore.
  enumerateContacts` and writes `~/.messages-mcp/contacts-cache.json`
  with canonicalized handle → display name pairs. The MCP reads this
  sidecar on every `stage_draft` call to populate
  `to_handle_name`. The sidecar refreshes on `CNContactStoreDidChange`.
- **Open at Login is on by default.** The app self-registers via
  `SMAppService` the first time it runs. Toggle off via the popover
  footer, or via System Settings → General → Login Items.
- **Race trade-off**: both the MCP `send_draft` tool and the
  menu bar app's Send button check `sent_at` before sending, but a true
  simultaneous click on both isn't atomic — you could double-send. For
  a single-user single-recipient flow this is acceptable; if you ever
  scale this up, add an `flock` on the draft file in both code paths.

# Tests

```sh
bun test
```

104 tests, ~100ms — pure-function + in-memory SQL + sidecar reader.
Coverage highlights:

- `decode.test.ts` — attributedBody typedstream decoder (short/long lengths, UTF-8, malformed input).
- `open.test.ts` — Apple-epoch ↔ ISO-8601 round-trips for both nanosecond (High Sierra+) and seconds (legacy) forms.
- `schema.test.ts` — Zod input validation: 2-year deep-history reject, 2-char minimums, handle format, body length cap.
- `storage/drafts.test.ts` — staging, list ordering, mark-sent persistence, symlink-clobber defense, atomic-rename + dir mtime, backward-compat normalization for older drafts.
- `storage/contacts-cache.test.ts` — sidecar JSON read path, malformed-input tolerance, schema-version mismatch detection.
- `chatdb/queries.test.ts` — end-to-end SQL against an in-memory chat.db fixture, covering pagination (strict `before`), contact-name widening, and `attributedBody` decode in search. Uses test seams `_setChatDbForTesting` + `_setContactsForTesting` to inject fixtures.
- `tools/health.test.ts` — `canonHandlePublic` canonicalization + probe block resolution logic.

---

# What this does NOT do

- **iOS.** Apple does not allow third-party access to Messages on iOS.
  There is no workaround short of jailbreaking.
- **Network.** Stdio only. If you ever want a cloud agent to call this,
  wrap the same query + draft code behind a tunnel + bearer secret —
  the data layer stays unchanged.
- **Attachments, tapbacks, reactions.** Reads them as plain message
  rows where they appear; doesn't decode payloads.

# Cutting a release (maintainer)

The pre-built release is produced by `scripts/build-release.sh`, which
builds + signs + notarizes both binaries with Apple's notary service and
packages them into a self-contained zip.

### One-time setup

1. Install a **Developer ID Application** certificate (Xcode → Settings
   → Accounts → Manage Certificates → + → Developer ID Application).
2. Generate an app-specific password at https://appleid.apple.com →
   Sign-In and Security → App-Specific Passwords. Label it
   `imessage-drafts-mcp-notarytool`.
3. Store it in your Keychain:
   ```sh
   xcrun notarytool store-credentials imessage-drafts-mcp-notary \
     --apple-id <your-developer-account-email> \
     --team-id <your-team-id> \
     --password <app-specific-password>
   ```

### Cutting a release

```sh
# 1. Tag the commit you want to ship and push.
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0

# 2. Build the release zip. Takes ~5-10 min (notarization round-trip).
bash scripts/build-release.sh v0.2.0
# → produces dist/imessage-drafts-mcp-v0.2.0.zip

# 3. Publish via gh CLI.
gh release create v0.2.0 dist/imessage-drafts-mcp-v0.2.0.zip \
  --title 'imessage-drafts-mcp v0.2.0' \
  --notes 'See CHANGELOG / commit history.'
```

The build script fails loudly if no Developer ID cert is found OR if
notarytool credentials aren't set up — no slow rebuild waste. After
zip is produced, it auto-extracts to a temp dir and runs
`spctl --assess` against the unzipped `.app` to make sure Gatekeeper
will accept it on end-user machines. If that check fails, the script
exits 1 instead of shipping a broken release.

Override the notarytool profile name (e.g. for CI) via
`NOTARY_PROFILE=...`. Override the signing identity via `CODESIGN_IDENTITY=...`.
