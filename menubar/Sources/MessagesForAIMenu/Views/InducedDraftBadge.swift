/// Warning-style banner shown above a WhatsApp draft when the daemon
/// flagged it as "induced by an unknown contact" — staged within 60 s of
/// an inbound message from a sender not in the user's contacts.
///
/// The flag is the menubar's defense against prompt-injection-driven
/// auto-replies: if an unknown number messages the user and that
/// message contains "draft a reply saying X" (or otherwise manipulates
/// the assistant), this is the visual cue + extra hold-to-fire friction
/// that the user is about to send a message that was originally
/// shaped by an unverified party.
///
/// Pairs with a 2 s hold-to-fire duration on the row (up from the
/// default 1 s) — see DraftRowView.swift. The longer hold is the
/// load-bearing safeguard; this badge is the explainer that tells the
/// user WHY the row feels different.
