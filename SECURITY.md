# Security Considerations

This document is the honest threat model for **Messages for AI** — the
.app that ships the menubar UI plus the iMessage and WhatsApp MCP
transports. Read it before installing — the trust profile is non-trivial,
and the WhatsApp transport in v0.3.0 adds a third-party-messaging risk
surface that didn't exist in v0.2.x.

## Summary

You are giving a single .app the following macOS-level privileges:

1. **Full Disk Access (FDA)** — required to read `chat.db`. macOS does
   not expose a "chat.db-only" scope; the FDA grant lets every binary
   inside the .app read **any file** in your home directory. (The
   .app's CFBundleIdentifier is the TCC grant key — one grant covers
   the menubar, the iMessage MCP, the WhatsApp stdio MCP, and the
   WhatsApp background daemon. See "Bundle identity" below.)
2. **Automation control of Messages.app** — granted on first iMessage
   send. Lets the binary spawn `osascript` to send iMessages/SMS to
   any recipient you have, without further prompting.
3. **Open-at-login** (menu bar app) — defaults on; the menu bar app
   auto-launches when you sign in. Toggleable in Settings.
4. **WhatsApp account linkage** (opt-in, off by default). Pairing
   adds your WhatsApp account to the Baileys session on this Mac;
   the daemon can read and send WhatsApp messages on your behalf
   until you unlink. WhatsApp's ToS does not officially sanction
   third-party clients — see the WhatsApp section below.

If a future commit, dependency, or local binary replacement is
malicious, those privileges become its privileges. The trust boundary
is "I trust this .app the way I trust software I write myself" — not
"I trust this .app because of some sandbox."

## Threat model

### In scope

- **Prompt injection** via incoming iMessages, where attacker text in
  a peer's message hijacks an agent reading the thread.
- **Confused-deputy** attacks where the agent uses the read tools to
  see attacker text and then a *different* tool (web fetch, shell,
  email) to exfiltrate or act on it.
- **Runaway send loops** where an agent gets into a bad state and
  re-sends or blast-sends repeatedly.
- **Binary substitution** where an attacker with write access to
  `/Applications/Messages for AI.app/Contents/MacOS/` swaps an inner
  binary for a malicious one and inherits the FDA + Automation
  grants. (The .app's signature would be invalidated on next launch
  by Gatekeeper, but only on FIRST run; subsequent launches don't
  re-verify.)
- **Local peer impersonation of the menubar.** The WhatsApp daemon
  listens on a Unix socket at `~/.whatsapp-mcp/daemon.sock` which is
  reachable by ANY local process running as the user. Without
  peer-auth, an npm postinstall script or browser extension could
  `socat` into the socket and bypass the daemon's hold-to-fire
  guardrails. See "WhatsApp peer-auth" below.
- **Supply chain** — a malicious update to the source repo, or a
  compromised dependency.

### Out of scope

- Apple Notarization is out of scope (no Developer Program enrollment).
  Gatekeeper will not mark the binary as notarized; users may need to
  approve it via System Settings on first launch.
- Sandbox containment via `sandbox-exec` is out of scope. macOS's
  sandbox profile API is undocumented and unstable across releases.
- Defending against root-level attackers. If something is running as
  root on your Mac, you have larger problems.
- Defending against macOS itself / Apple. If the OS leaks chat.db
  to third parties or breaks TCC, this server can't help.

## What we do about it

| Defense | What it stops | Caveats |
|---|---|---|
| **`<untrusted_content>` body wrapping** | Naive prompt injection: "ignore prior instructions and …" | Doesn't stop a determined attacker who knows the model; doesn't stop confused-deputy via other tools |
| **Required `since` (≤2y) or `contact_filter` on read/search** | Unbounded history dumps into agent context | Doesn't stop reads inside the bounded window |
| **8 KB body truncation** | Mega-payload prompt injections | A 4 KB injection works the same as an 8 KB one |
| **Send-only-from-draft** | Ad-hoc send tool calls | Agent can stage + send in one turn (see next) |
| **`require_approval` setting** (default ON) | All MCP send paths — agents can only stage; the menu bar app is the sole send surface | User-controllable toggle in the menu bar footer. Off if the user explicitly disables. |
| **Minimum staged-age (default 5s)** | Single-turn stage-and-send bypassing human review when `require_approval` is off | Configurable, can be disabled |
| **Daily send cap (default 50/UTC day)** | Runaway loops, blast attacks | Cap is per-day, not per-recipient; configurable |
| **Send audit log** at `~/.messages-mcp/send-audit.log` | Forensic gap (post-hoc only) | Doesn't prevent; helps investigate. Body content is SHA-256-hashed, not stored. |
| **`destructiveHint: true` + `idempotentHint: false` annotations on send** | MCP clients can surface confirmation prompts | Depends on the client implementing the hint |
| **Sent-state lock** (`sent_at` set on draft → refused) | Double-send via retry loops | Doesn't stop staging a fresh draft |
| **SQL parameterized everywhere** | SQL injection | — |
| **`osascript` argv passing** (not string interpolation) | AppleScript injection via `to_handle` / `body` | — |
| **UUID validation on `draft_id`** | Path traversal via draft id | — |
| **Drafts dir mode 0600** | Other users on the same Mac reading drafts | Other processes running as you can still read |
| **Stable codesign identifier** | Adhoc rebuilds invalidating FDA on every install | Doesn't stop binary replacement |
| **No iMessage-side network listener, no iMessage outbound calls** | Network-based attack surface on the iMessage transport | The WhatsApp daemon DOES open an outbound WebSocket to WhatsApp Web; see the WhatsApp section. |
| **`PRAGMA query_only = ON` + `readonly: true` on `chat.db`** | Accidental writes corrupting Messages state | — |
| **WhatsApp peer-auth: runtime self-identity match** | Local processes other than the .app's own binaries from connecting to the WhatsApp daemon's Unix socket | Bypassed when daemon runs with `WHATSAPP_MCP_DEV=1`; the daemon refuses dev mode if its own binary is signed for production. |
| **WhatsApp session.db AES-GCM at rest** | Plaintext exfiltration of the Baileys session credential (the keys that authorize WhatsApp message read/send on your behalf) | Encryption key lives in the macOS Keychain; the daemon process and any other binary running as you can both reach it. |

## Bundle identity

All inner binaries (`MessagesForAIMenu`, `imessage-drafts-mcp`,
`whatsapp-drafts-mcp`, `whatsapp-drafts-daemon`) ship in
`/Applications/Messages for AI.app/Contents/MacOS/` and are
codesigned with `--identifier com.sunriselabs.messages-for-ai` — the
same string as the .app's `CFBundleIdentifier`. TCC keys grants by the
running process's codesign `Identifier=`, so one FDA grant on the .app
covers every inner Mach-O. This is also the foundation of the WhatsApp
peer-auth check: the daemon authorizes only peers whose Identifier and
TeamIdentifier match its own.

## WhatsApp transport (opt-in)

The WhatsApp transport uses [@whiskeysockets/baileys][baileys], an
unofficial WhatsApp Web protocol client. WhatsApp's Terms of Service do
not officially sanction third-party clients. Practical implications:

- Your account COULD be flagged or banned. This is unlikely in practice
  for normal-volume personal use, but it's not zero risk — read the
  Baileys repo's own warnings before pairing.
- The transport is OFF by default. The onboarding wizard makes you opt
  in explicitly. You can unlink any time from Settings.
- The daemon stores your Baileys session credentials at
  `~/.whatsapp-mcp/session.db`, AES-GCM wrapped with a key derived from
  a per-Mac Keychain item. Anything running as you can still reach the
  Keychain item — defense-in-depth, not full isolation.
- Daemon stdout/stderr are piped to
  `~/.messages-mcp/logs/whatsapp-daemon.log` (10 MB rotation). Logs are
  message-content-free, but they DO record JIDs and connection events
  — review before sharing.

## Configuration knobs

User-controllable in the menu bar UI:

- **iMessage / WhatsApp enabled toggles** (Settings sheet). Toggling
  WhatsApp off SIGTERMs the bundled daemon; toggling on respawns it.
- **Require approval to send** (per-transport, default ON). When on,
  MCP `send_draft` is disabled entirely — every send must come from a
  human pressing Hold-to-Fire in the menu bar app. Persists to
  `~/.messages-mcp/settings.json` (schema v2) under
  `transports.imessage.require_approval` and (for WhatsApp's own MCP)
  `~/.whatsapp-mcp/settings.json`; both MCP servers read on every send
  call so toggling takes effect immediately.

Env vars (configure for trusted automation contexts):

- `IMESSAGE_MIN_DRAFT_AGE_MS` — minimum age (ms) a draft must be before
  it can be sent via MCP. Default `5000`. Set to `0` to disable. Only
  applies when `require_approval` is off.
- `IMESSAGE_DAILY_SEND_CAP` — maximum sends per UTC day. Default `50`.
  Set to `0` to disable.
- `MESSAGES_MCP_IDENTIFIER` — codesign identifier embedded in every
  inner MCP binary by `scripts/dev-install.sh`. Default
  `com.sunriselabs.messages-for-ai` (same as the parent .app bundle's
  `CFBundleIdentifier`). For the `.app`-wrap architecture, every inner
  binary's identifier MUST match the bundle's so that TCC's grant on
  the .app covers all running processes. Changing this to a value
  that differs from the bundle's identifier will break FDA — TCC
  compares the running process's `Identifier=` against the granted
  identifier as strings; mismatch = no grant match.
- `WHATSAPP_MCP_DEV=1` — bypasses the WhatsApp daemon's peer-auth.
  Use only when running the daemon from source; the daemon refuses to
  start under this flag if its own binary is signed for production.

## What you should do as a user

1. **Read the source before installing.** The codebase is ~5000 lines
   of TypeScript (across two MCP transports) + ~1500 lines of Swift.
   A careful review is feasible.
2. **Build from source.** Don't run prebuilt binaries someone else
   shipped you.
3. **Pin to a tag.** Don't track `main` in production-feeling setups.
4. **Don't pair this server with an agent that also has destructive
   non-iMessage tools** unless you have a reason to. The interesting
   attack is a confused-deputy: read tool sees attacker text → agent
   uses some *other* tool to exfiltrate or act.
5. **Use the menu bar app for the human-review pattern.** Configure
   your MCP client to NOT auto-approve `send_draft`. Have
   agents stage-only; you click Send in the menu bar.
6. **Audit your daily send-audit log occasionally.** If something
   weird happened, it's in `~/.messages-mcp/send-audit.log`.
7. **Treat `/Applications/Messages for AI.app` like an SSH key.**
   Permissions matter. If a compromised app on your Mac could write
   to `/Applications/`, it could replace an inner binary and inherit
   the FDA + Automation grants. The .app's signature would invalidate
   on next Gatekeeper check, but Gatekeeper only re-verifies on first
   launch — subsequent launches don't.
8. **Audit `~/.messages-mcp/logs/whatsapp-daemon.log` if you've paired
   WhatsApp.** Connection events + JIDs only (no message content), but
   useful when something looks off.

## Reporting a vulnerability

For security issues that should not be discussed in public:

- Open a GitHub Security Advisory on this repo (preferred — gives
  the maintainer a private channel and a way to coordinate disclosure).
- Or email the maintainer; see the GitHub profile on the repo.

For things you're comfortable discussing publicly (style nits,
mitigations you think we should add, etc.), open a regular issue.

I (the maintainer) am one person doing this in spare time. Expect a
response within a few days for routine issues; acute security
disclosures will get a same-day acknowledgment when possible.
