// missing on the Messages for AI app, whether the AddressBook DB opened
// but is empty, whether the contact is genuinely absent, or whether the
// phone-number canonicalization mismatched. This tool answers all of that.
//
// Post-daemon-refactor: chat.db + AddressBook are FDA-gated, so the daemon
// (which holds FDA, inherited from the menu-bar app) performs them. The MCP
// reads only the contacts sidecar locally (no FDA). If the daemon is
// unreachable, the remediation points at launching the menu-bar app.
